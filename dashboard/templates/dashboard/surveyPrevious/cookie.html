However, SurveyTimeForMe will continue to count the fact that a browser came to a site, but that count will not be associated with your browser, and if you return to SurveyTimeForMeâ€™s Fulcrum platform, you may opt-in to online measurement and research services again. This opt-out is cookie based. So, if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective. Additionally, different computers and different Internet browsers may all require their own version of the opt-out cookie.
