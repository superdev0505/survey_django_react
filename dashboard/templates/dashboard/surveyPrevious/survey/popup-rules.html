                <p>Each online survey questionnaire contains 60 questions. 5 questions will be repeated in order to ensure
                    you are paying close attention and answering the questionnaire accurately. Survey research companies
                    rely upon honest and accurate answers. Any of our online surveys that have contradicting answers will be
                    counted as invalid and incomplete. After you complete one of our online surveys, you can move on to the
                    next survey. We are creating new online surveys on a daily basis!</p>

                <p>None of the survey questions will ever ask you for personal identification questions. You are anonymous.
