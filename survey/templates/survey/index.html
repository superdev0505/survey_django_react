            <p> Specialized companies rely upon honest and accurate answers to cross reference results online, in order to improve the quality and accuracy of existing psychometric personality tests. Therefore, if the online voting quizzes you complete have contradicting answers, they won’t be counted as valid.</p>
            <p> After you complete one of our online quizzes, you will have the option to continue and begin the next quiz. There is a high demand for data, so there is no shortage of quiz opportunities!</p>
            <p> None of the quiz questions will ever ask you for personal identification questions such as your email, phone or address. You are 100% anonymous. Feel free to refer to our privacy policy for more details.</p>
            <p> It’s crucial that you provide us with truthful and thoughtful answers. Providing false information in quizzes, speeding or attempting to defraud the results will lead to a block and your quiz results will be invalid.</p>
            <p> We have several internal algorithms in place to detect the truthfulness of your answers and look for contradictions between answers from similar questions. For example, we repeat some questions from every quiz on purpose to see if you will provide the same answer, as well as place certain questions with a single plausible answer. These measures act as attention checks, therefore if we notice contradictions and / or deviations, then we can’t trust the data and any given answers will be invalid.</p>
            <p> As long as you take your time and think how you are answering you will be fine.</p>
